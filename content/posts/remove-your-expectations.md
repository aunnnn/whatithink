Remove all expectations and you’ll be happy.

When you expect, you make artificial rules about how the world works. When you expect, you will depend on something outside your control. 

* Gave something to someone? Don't expect to get anything back.
* Worked hard? Don't expect to get a raise. They're different things.
* Applied for a volunteer position? Don't expect to easily get it just because it's working for free.

But when it comes to your own actions, which is _the only thing you can control in your life_, you can expect results from it.

* Worked hard? Expect your work to get better overtime.


* Exercised? Expect a better shape.

**Don’t expect anything outside your own control.**
