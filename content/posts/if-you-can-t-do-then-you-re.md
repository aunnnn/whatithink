Many people like to falsely imply things:

* The _ability_: 
  * "If you can't drive, you're not an adult yet."
* The _knowledge_: 
  * "You don't know who this is? Where did you live? I can't believe it."
  * "You don't understand the question?"

It usually begins with an assumption, then ends with an insult. Of course sometimes they won't say those explicitly, but they already judge, unconsciously.

These are nonsense. They are not related in anyway.

People can do or know something, only when they used to do, or read/study/listen from somewhere. That's it. Nothing more you can imply from that.

If they can't do (or don't know) something, it probably means they just never do it, not familiar with it, or never have a reason to do it in the first place.

**It's hard to find things that are actually related, the cause and effect, that you can make a reasonable inference.**
