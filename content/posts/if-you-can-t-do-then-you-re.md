Many people like to imply things, but falsely:

* The _ability to do_ something: "If you can't drive, you're not an adult yet."
* The _knowledge_ of something: "You don't know who this is? Where did you live? I can't believe it."

Of course they won't say those explicitly, but they have already judge unconsciously.

These are nonsense. They are not related in anyway.

People can do, or know something, when they used to do, or read/study/listen from somewhere. That's it. Nothing more you can imply from that. 

If they can't do (or don't know) something, it probably means they just never do it, not familiar with it, or never have a reason to do it in the first place.

**It's hard to find things that are actually related, the cause and effect, that you can make a reasonable inference.**
