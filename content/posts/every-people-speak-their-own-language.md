On the surface, you might think we're speaking the same language (in your country). However, each word means different things for people, even the simple word like 'take', 'give', or 'get'.

A more complex verb like 'think', 'believe', 'remember' even get messier.

And we're not talking about a more complex noun like 'innovation', 'technology', 'machine', 'conciousness' yet.
