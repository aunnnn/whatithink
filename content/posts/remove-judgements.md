Judgements here are _unscientific assumptions_ on how the world works. They're "rules of the world" you accumulate over lifetime, to efficiently make quick response and navigate your life.

Most of the time these rules and reasonings are wrong. E.g:

* "He dress badly, he must be poor."
* "He is smart, he must be born that way."
* "You're a bad person if you don't believe in <religion>. See, she is a doctor and she also believes in <religion>."
* "___ is bad (I heard from someone)."

It's sad how a lot of people just make a false reasoning up on their own, **think it's right, believe in it immediately, then hold on to it for dear life.**

Before adding a rule to the decision-making part of your brain, think carefully if it can be concluded that way.
