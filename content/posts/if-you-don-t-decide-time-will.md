Sometimes, we want to decide something. It could be a simple thing like what tasks to do tomorrow? We feel guilty, in the way that we know that we won’t finish the tasks that we want to get done.

But in the end, you got a limited time, and a lot of tasks to do. So if you won’t decide earlier, **you still will pass that point of time where you do things in suboptimal way which you could plan it better**, and worse, you don’t have focus too. You get less done overall if you don’t decide.
