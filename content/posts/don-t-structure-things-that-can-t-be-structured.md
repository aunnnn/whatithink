Sometimes people put structure to things that can't be structured.

Like Buddhism, or any other religion. If you realize and accept that it's just something designed by someone like us to guide our lives, then it's fine.

**But many people merge reality with religion's laws**. For example, people who believe in Buddhism sometimes would get a question like "If I do something in that way, would it violate the ___ law".

Then the religion's "practitioners" come out and show their analysis why it's ok (or not) to do something in which way. Bonus point if they use their own invented terms to look smart.

The thing is you're not supposed to take religions seriously in the first place like laws of physics.

Please step back and look into bubbles, don't be afraid to categorize religions as they are.
