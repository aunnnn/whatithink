Unlike other actions and verbs like walking, running, you don’t know what to do when you have a todo item as ‘thinking’. It’s hard to know how to progress or even execute this action.

Should we come up with certain process when we say we will think about something? That is, we might begin with searching background knowledge, then find similarities in the second step, etc., rigid steps.

Or should we let the mind wander and do whatever it wants to do?
