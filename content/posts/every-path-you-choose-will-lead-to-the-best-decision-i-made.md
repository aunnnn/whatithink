If you work hard, whatever path you choose, you’ll probably end up with certain opportunities, that otherwise could never have been taken by other paths.

When that time comes, you’ll think of that pivot point as “the best decision I’ve ever made”.

The thing is any path you choose could be the best decision you’ve ever made, only if you work hard.
