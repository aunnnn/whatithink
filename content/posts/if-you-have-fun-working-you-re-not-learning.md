In some jobs, like software developers, you can feel the fun during work. It's the satisfaction from building something. 

However, if you have fun while working, it means you're not learning anything new. You just have fun because you _do something you can already do_. You will be happy, and your brain is happy. **Learning happens only when you think and focus. Your brain will hurt, and it's not fun.**

I didn't say that you have to learn new things all the time. In a job you have to deliver the work, do things that you already know how to do for others.

But sometimes we can mistake work for learning. Simply working doesn't mean you're improving. Maybe it is, but a very slow rate.
