Without understanding if they're on the same page with the one who asks.

This usually applies on a discussion or debate of something subjective, like philosophy, politics, arts.

They ask, answer, ask back, respond, everything looks so smooth. What’s wrong?

**We're too afraid to admit we don't understand something other people say.** We could look stupid if we ask what they actually mean by __.

It's impossible to immediately understand a complex/subjective question, because _everyone speaks their own language_.

We should invest in figuring out the question, if not more, than an answer. What does it mean? What a term used clear? Do we agree on a definition? Do you actually mean something else? Do you refer in a situation where ___? Etc.

Don’t answer immediately, unless you completely understand everything about a question being asked.
