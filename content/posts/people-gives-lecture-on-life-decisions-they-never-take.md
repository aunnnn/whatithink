title = "People gives lecture on life decisions they never take"

+++
You can compare major life decisions objectively only when you have experience in both. No people can go through more than one major life decision, especially when those tie to your age. Like going to a university, they chose one school, they missed out others.

But many people still pretend they know something, and give lecture on which one is better.

It's fine to make an assumption, or tell what you think about a path. Just don't be so sure of them.
