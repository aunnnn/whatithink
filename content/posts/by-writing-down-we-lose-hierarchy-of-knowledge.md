title = "By writing down, we lose hierarchy of knowledge "

+++
We usually write texts to teach something by retrieving what we remember about that topic.

Then all this information is written down in a flattened manner. All hierarchies of knowledge are stripped down to plain text article, with only just header, paragraph, figures to explain things. That's too simplistic of hierarchy for knowledge.

The source of intelligence is in _its complex hierarchy, or how things are related to each other._

Transforming knowledge from your head down to texts is a good way to lose all such hierarchies.

The hard work is on the readers, who have to reconstruct and guess the original hierarchy of knowledge.

That's why it's hard to read math or scientific papers. We just pour down things that we have to cover in order to publish it, especially when the goal is not for comprehension.
