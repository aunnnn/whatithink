title = "By writing down, we lose hierarchy of knowledge "

+++
We usually write texts to teach something by retrieving what we remember about of that topic.

Then all these information are written down in flattened manner. All hierarchies of knowledge are stripped down to plain text article, with only just header, paragraph, figures to explain things. That's too simplistic of  hierarchy for knowledge.

The source of intelligence is in _its complex hierarchy, or how things are related with each other._

Transforming knowledge from your head down to texts is a good way to lose all such hierarchies.

The hard work is on the readers, who have to reconstruct and guess the original hierarchy of knowledge.

That's why it's hard to read math, or scientific papers. We just pour down things that we have to cover in order to publish it. The goal is not for comprehension.
