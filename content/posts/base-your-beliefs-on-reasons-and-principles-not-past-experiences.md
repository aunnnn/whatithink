Beliefs are at the edge of your reasoning. It's when you can't find enough reasons or proofs to justify some statements. That's when you have to take a leap of faith and trust it.

Ideally, we can think of everything with reasons. But when you can't, you have to simply belief in something. At that time, **at least base your beliefs on principles and reasons, not just raw experiences in the past.**

Not simply believing in raw experiences makes us difference from animals. We are able to learn higher-order lessons. We don't avoid knife just because we were once cut by it. We know that it's a tool, and if we use it with caution, it can do a lot of thing useful.
