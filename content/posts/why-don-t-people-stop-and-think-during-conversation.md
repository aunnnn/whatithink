We seem to understand everything someone says right away.

Why don’t we sometimes be honest, and say something like “Interesting, I don’t know how to reply, let me stop and think”, **"What do you mean by that?"**, or "When you say that word_,_ what do you actually mean"?

Instead, we directly interpret how we like it to be, then move on quickly to continue the conversation, in a wrong way.

These misunderstandings can be seen in interviews of many great people with radical thoughts. When they give insightful answer, the interviewer interprets it naively, in a simplistic way, and move on to the next question.
