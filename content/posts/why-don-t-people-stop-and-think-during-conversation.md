+++
We seem to understand everything our conversational partner says. 

Why don’t we sometimes be honest, to say something like “Interesting, I don’t know how to reply, let me stop and think”?

Instead, we interpret how we like, then move only quickly to the conversation.

This is also true in interview of smart people, when they give insightful answers but the interviewer interprets naively and in simple way, to just move on to the next question.
