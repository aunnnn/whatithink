We usually praise confidence. Things like “project confidence”, “be the alpha”, “close that deals” are all over the places.

**But there’s no use to be confident when you don’t have to, or when it doesn’t add anything positive to you and others around you.**

Of course, you should act confident when you’re among social events, or during the time you’re trying to sell yourselves or products, to increase the chance you seal a deal or pass an interview.

But when you’re with friends and families, there’s no need to be confident, when you are not 100% sure of your knowledge.

When we’re confident, what are we confident in? _It’s our own knowledge_. Confident means we’re 100% sure of our knowledge.

But knowledge is tricky to be 100% sure, unless it’s some mathematical fact. You usually don’t know what you don’t know. So don’t claim to know something when you’re not.
