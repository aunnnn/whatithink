+++
Many people tend to finalize their thoughts. They speak with assertiveness, like it's a truth. Like it's correct. That the world works that way. That's how we do things here.

Please give more time to your thoughts. They're never finalized. They're not facts. Say 'maybe'. Say 'I think'. Say 'I guess'.
