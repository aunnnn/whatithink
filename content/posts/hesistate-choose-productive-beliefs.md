When there's a thing you're unsure about its scientific facts, choose one that is productive for you. One that gets you optimal results.

E.g., is someone born smart (or have some aptitude for being so), or is it purely due to his/her practice.

It's hard to know for sure the scientific answer for this. But those who believe the former, they probably tend to give up more than the latter. Believing that someone's abilities depend purely on one's practice will get you so much further.
